Ink — A Modern Full-Stack Blogging Platform

Ink is a clean, minimal, and scalable blogging platform built with a real-world full-stack architecture.
It enables users to authenticate securely, create and manage blogs, and read content through a fast, API-driven interface.

Unlike typical tutorial projects, Ink focuses on production-style design decisions, edge deployment, and clear separation of concerns.
